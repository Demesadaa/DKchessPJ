# PGN File Validator by Demetre Kanachadze


People save chess games in text files using a format called PGN.


Sometimes, PGN files have mistakes.
This program, written in Java by me (Demetre Kanachadze), reads PGN files.
It checks them carefully to find any mistakes according to the PGN rules.
This helps make sure the chess game information is correct.

To run this programm, you shoulda run code and then in terminal paste an absolute path of PGN file saved in your memory disk.
